# Design Patterns in Java

Welcome to the **Design Patterns in Java** repository! This collection is designed to help beginners understand and implement common design patterns in Java. Each example is simple, well-documented, and demonstrates the practical use of these patterns in real-world scenarios.

## Contents

- **Factory Pattern**  
  Learn how to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

- **Builder Pattern**  
  Simplify the construction of complex objects step by step.

- **Singleton Pattern**  
  Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:HaiYang-MengQi/DesignMode.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd DesignMode
```

## Usage

Each design pattern is demonstrated in its own package. You can explore the code, run the examples, and modify them to better understand how the patterns work.
